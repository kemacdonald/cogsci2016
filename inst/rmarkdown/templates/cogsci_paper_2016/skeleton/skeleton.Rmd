abstract: >
    Include no author information in the initial submission, to facilitate
    blind review.  The abstract should be one paragraph, indented 1/8 inch on both sides,
    in 9~point font with single spacing. The heading 'Abstract'
    should be 10~point, bold, centered, with one line of space below
    it. This one-paragraph abstract section is required only for standard
    six page proceedings papers. Following the abstract should be a blank
    line, followed by the header 'Keywords' and a list of
    descriptive keywords separated by semicolons, all in 9~point font, as
    shown below.
    
keywords: >
    Add your choice of indexing terms or keywords; kindly use a semi-colon; between each term.

# General Formatting Instructions 

For general information about authoring in markdown, see **[here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).**

The entire content of a paper (including figures, references, and anything else) can be no longer than six pages in the \textbf{initial submission}. In the \textbf{final submission}, the text of the paper, including an author line, must fit on six pages. Up to one additional page can be used for acknowledgements and references.

The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns with an
overall width of 7 inches (17.8 cm) and length of 9.25 inches (23.5
cm), with 0.25 inches between the columns. Leave two line spaces
between the last author listed and the text of the paper; the text of
the paper (starting with the abstract) should begin no less than 2.75 inches below the top of the
page. The left margin should be 0.75 inches and the top margin should
be 1 inch.  \textbf{The right and bottom margins will depend on
whether you use U.S. letter or A4 paper, so you must be sure to
measure the width of the printed text.} Use 10~point Times Roman
with 12~point vertical spacing, unless otherwise specified.

The title should be in 14~point bold font, centered. The title should
be formatted with initial caps (the first letter of content words
capitalized and the rest lower case). In the initial submission, the
phrase ``Anonymous CogSci submission'' should appear below the title,
centered, in 11~point bold font.  In the final submission, each
author's name should appear on a separate line, 11~point bold, and
centered, with the author's email address in parentheses. Under each
author's name list the author's affiliation and postal address in
ordinary 10~point type.

Indent the first line of each paragraph by 1/8~inch (except for the
first paragraph of a new section). Do not add extra vertical space
between paragraphs.


# First-Level Headings

First level headings should be in 12 point , initial caps, bold and
centered. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~line space
below the heading.

## Second-Level Headings

Second level headings should be 11 point , initial caps, bold, and
flush left. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~ line
space below the heading.

### Third-Level Headings

Third-level headings should be 10 point , initial caps, bold, and flush
left. Leave one line space above the heading, but no space after the
heading.

# Formalities, Footnotes, and Floats

Use standard APA citation format. Citations within the text should
include the author's last name and year. If the authors' names are
included in the sentence, place only the year in parentheses, as in
[-@NewellSimon1972a], but otherwise place the entire reference in
parentheses with the authors and year separated by a comma
[@NewellSimon1972a]. List multiple references alphabetically and
separate them by semicolons [@ChalnickBillman1988a; @NewellSimon1972a]. 
Use the et. al. construction only after listing all the authors to a
publication in an earlier reference and for citations with four or
more authors.

For more information on citations in RMarkdown, see **[here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citations).**

## Footnotes

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes in 9 point type at the
bottom of the page on which they appear. Precede the footnote with a
horizontal rule.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.} You can also use 
markdown formatting to include footnotes using this syntax [^1].

## Figures

All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
number and caption, in 10 point, after the figure with one line space
above the caption and one line space below it. If necessary, leave extra white space at
the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, or
set wide figures across both columns.

## Two-column images

You can read local images using png package for example and plot 
it like a regular plot using grid.raster from the grid package. 
With this method you have full control of the size of your image. **Note: Image must be in .png file format for the readPNG function to work.**

You might want to display a wide figure across both columns. To do this, you change the `fig.env` chunk option to `figure*`. To align the image in the center of the page, set `fig.align` option to `center`. To format the width of your caption text, you set the `num.cols.cap` option to `2`.

```{r 2-col-image, fig.env = "figure*", fig.pos = "h", fig.width=4, fig.height=2, fig.align = "center", set.cap.width=T, num.cols.cap=2, fig.cap = "This image spans both columns. And the caption text is limited to 0.8 of the width of the document."}
img <- png::readPNG("figs/walrus.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```

## One-column images

Single column is the default option, but if you want set it explicitly, set `fig.env` to `figure`. Notice that the `num.cols` option for the caption width is set to `1`.

```{r image, fig.env = "figure", fig.pos = "H", fig.align='center', fig.width=2, fig.height=2, set.cap.width=T, num.cols.cap=1, fig.cap = "One column image."}
img <- png::readPNG("figs/lab_logo_stanford.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```


## R Plots

You can use R chunks directly to plot graphs. And you can use latex floats in the
fig.pos chunk option to have more control over the location of your plot on the page. For more information on latex placement specifiers see **[here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions)**

```{r plot, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "H", fig.align = "center", fig.width=2, fig.height=2, fig.cap = "R plot" }
x <- 0:100
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = data.frame(x, y), 
                aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## Tables

Number tables consecutively; place the table number and title (in
10 point) above the table with one line space above the caption and
one line space below it, as in Table 1. You may float
tables to the top or bottom of a column, set wide tables across both
columns.

You can use the xtable function in the xtable package.

```{r xtable, results="asis"}
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(n)
out <- lm(y ~ x)

tab1 <- xtable::xtable(summary(out)$coef, digits=c(0, 2, 2, 1, 2), 
                       caption = "This table prints across one column.")

print(tab1, type="latex", comment = F, table.placement = "H")
```

# Acknowledgements

the end of the paper.
