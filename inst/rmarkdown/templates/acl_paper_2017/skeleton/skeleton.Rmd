abstract: 
    "This document contains the instructions for preparing a camera-ready
  manuscript for the proceedings of EACL-2017. The document itself
  conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of
  what your manuscript should look like. These instructions should be
  used for both papers submitted for review and for final versions of
  accepted papers.  Authors are asked to conform to all the directions
  reported in this document."

# Important citation stuff! READ!

## Why we can't have nice things

So because the ACL committee wants their `.tex` files all nice and consistent, the old version of this package isn't good for what they want.  The Markdown-to-Latex conversion would automatically add in the references and citations, but would literally hardcode them into the `.tex` file.  We can't have that, now can we?  The only ways you were allowed to cite in your `.tex` file was with `\cite{Gusfield97}`, `\shortcite{Gusfield97}`, or `\newcite{Gusfield97}`, which corresponded to "(Gusfield, 1997)", "(1997)", or "Gusfield (1997)", respectively.

This means you couldn't do anything like "(e.g., Gusfield, 2017)", and their `.bst` file was incompatible with `natbib`. Obviously.  However, I have come to the rescue.  In the `eacl2017.sty` file in this package, I have added my own bit of magic: the `\barecite{}` command, which corresponds to "Burchill, 2017".  Notice this version doesn't have parentheses, so you can get stuff like "(e.g., Burchill, 2017)" with `(e.g., \barecite{Gusfield97})`.  Just be careful about making sure you don't forget parentheses.  Also not that when you submit the `.zip` folder, you should make sure to include the edited `eacl2017.sty` file.

## Examples

 * `\cite{Gusfield97}` becomes \cite{Gusfield97}
 * `\shortcite{Gusfield97}` becomes \shortcite{Gusfield97}
 * `\newcite{Gusfield97}` becomes \newcite{Gusfield97}
 * `\barecite{Gusfield97}` becomes \barecite{Gusfield97}
 * `\cite{Gusfield97,Aho72}` becomes \cite{Gusfield97,Aho72}
 * `\barecite{Gusfield97,Aho72}` becomes \barecite{Gusfield97,Aho72}
 
**Wait, _are those citations appearing as question marks?_  Don't worry, read on!**

## The two-step process of knitting this file

Because the ACL's you-need-to-use-our-citing-function formatting doesn't work well with R Markdown--which really likes to compile its own citations--knitting this is now a two-step process.  After you get it how you want it in RMarkdown, knit as usual.  You'll see that all citations are question marks, and that the bibliography is missing.  This is natural, don't panic.

For the current purposes, let's assume this file we're in right now is called `acl_draft.Rmd`.  Navigate into the directory containing `acl_draft.Rmd` via a terminal.  Then run the following command (swapping out your actual file name for "acl_draft")

`pdflatex acl_draft.tex; pdflatex acl_draft.tex; bibtex acl_draft.aux; pdflatex acl_draft.tex; pdflatex acl_draft.tex`

Now, check the `.pdf` file.  If all went well, it should now have all the citations in it as well as the reference section.  Good luck!

# General Formatting Instructions 

All the default content below is lifted directly from Kyle MacDonald's Cogsci 2016 project (https://github.com/kemacdonald/cogsci2016), which this entire package is based on.  I haven't changed it, so it's up to you to ignore as you please.

For general information about authoring in markdown, see **http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html.**

For standard spoken papers and standard posters, the entire 
contribution (including figures, references, everything) can be 
no longer than six pages. For abstract posters, the entire contribution 
can be no longer than one page. For symposia, the entire contribution 
can be no longer than two pages.

The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns with an
overall width of 7 inches (17.8 cm) and length of 9.25 inches (23.5
cm), with 0.25 inches between the columns. Leave two line spaces
between the last author listed and the text of the paper. The left
margin should be 0.75 inches and the top margin should be 1 inch.
\textbf{The right and bottom margins will depend on whether you use
U.S. letter or A4 paper, so you must be sure to measure the width of
the printed text.} Use 10 point Times Roman with 12 point vertical
spacing, unless otherwise specified.

The title should be in 14 point, bold, and centered. The title should
be formatted with initial caps (the first letter of content words
capitalized and the rest lower case). Each author's name should appear
on a separate line, 11 point bold, and centered, with the author's
email address in parentheses. Under each author's name list the
author's affiliation and postal address in ordinary 10 point  type.

Indent the first line of each paragraph by 1/8~inch (except for the
first paragraph of a new section). Do not add extra vertical space
between paragraphs.

# First-Level Headings

First level headings should be in 12 point , initial caps, bold and
centered. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~line space
below the heading.

## Second-Level Headings

Second level headings should be 11 point , initial caps, bold, and
flush left. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~ line
space below the heading.

### Third-Level Headings

Third-level headings should be 10 point , initial caps, bold, and flush
left. Leave one line space above the heading, but no space after the
heading.

# Formalities, Footnotes, and Floats

## Footnotes

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes in 9 point type at the
bottom of the page on which they appear. Precede the footnote with a
horizontal rule.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}

## Figures

All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
number and caption, in 10 point, after the figure with one line space
above the caption and one line space below it. If necessary, leave extra white space at
the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, or
set wide figures across both columns.

## Two-column images

You can read local images using png package for example and plot 
it like a regular plot using grid.raster from the grid package. 
With this method you have full control of the size of your image. **Note: Image must be in .png file format for the readPNG function to work.**

You might want to display a wide figure across both columns. To do this, you can change the `fig.env` chunk option to `figure*`. To align the image in the center of the page, set `fig.align` option to `center`. 

```{r 2-col-image, fig.env = "figure*", fig.pos = "h", fig.width=4, fig.height=2, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "This image spans both columns."}
img <- png::readPNG("figs/walrus.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```

## One-column images

Single column is the default option, but if you want set it explicitly, set `fig.env` to `figure`.

```{r image, fig.env = "figure", fig.pos = "H", fig.align='center', fig.width=2, fig.height=2, fig.cap = "One column image."}
img <- png::readPNG("figs/lab_logo_stanford.png")
grid::grid.raster(img)
```


## R Plots

You can use R chunks directly to plot graphs. And you can use latex floats in the
fig.pos chunk option to have more control over the location of your plot on the page. For more information on latex placement specifiers see **https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions**

```{r plot, fig.env="figure", fig.pos = "H", fig.align = "center", fig.width=2, fig.height=2, fig.cap = "R plot" }
x <- 0:100
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = data.frame(x, y), 
       aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## Tables

Number tables consecutively; place the table number and title (in
10 point) above the table with one line space above the caption and
one line space below it, as in Table 1. You may float
tables to the top or bottom of a column, set wide tables across both
columns.

You can use the xtable function in the xtable package.

```{r xtable, results="asis"}
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(n)
out <- lm(y ~ x)

tab1 <- xtable::xtable(summary(out)$coef, digits=c(0, 2, 2, 1, 2), 
                      caption = "This table prints across one column.")

print(tab1, type="latex", comment = F, table.placement = "H")
```

# Acknowledgements

Place acknowledgments (including funding information) in a section at
the end of the paper.

```{r}
# References will be generated after this point after you run the following command. <file> is this file, but without the extension.  You should include the full path if you aren't running the command in the same directory.  This command should be run in a terminal, btw.

# The command:
# pdflatex <file>.tex; pdflatex <file>.tex; bibtex <file>.aux; pdflatex <file>.tex; pdflatex <file>.tex

# After running this command, check the new pdf file. It should hopefully have all the citations added in.
```
