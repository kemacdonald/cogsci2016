\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The abstract should be one paragraph, indented 1/8 inch on both sides,
in 9 point font with single spacing. The heading Abstract should be 10
point, bold, centered, with one line space below it. This one-paragraph
abstdddddddract section is required only for standard spoken papers and
standard posters (i.e., those presentations that will be represented by
six page papers in the Proceedings).
\end{abstract}

\section{General Formatting
Instructions}\label{general-formatting-instructions}

For standard spoken papers and standard posters, the entire contribution
(including figures, references, everything) can be no longer than six
pages. For abstract posters, the entire contribution can be no longer
than one page. For symposia, the entire contribution can be no longer
than two pages.

The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns with an overall
width of 7 inches (17.8 cm) and length of 9.25 inches (23.5 cm), with
0.25 inches between the columns. Leave two line spaces between the last
author listed and the text of the paper. The left margin should be 0.75
inches and the top margin should be 1 inch.
\textbf{The right and bottom margins will depend on whether you use
U.S. letter or A4 paper, so you must be sure to measure the width of
the printed text.} Use 10 point Times Roman with 12 point vertical
spacing, unless otherwise specified.

The title should be in 14 point, bold, and centered. The title should be
formatted with initial caps (the first letter of content words
capitalized and the rest lower case). Each author's name should appear
on a separate line, 11 point bold, and centered, with the author's email
address in parentheses. Under each author's name list the author's
affiliation and postal address in ordinary 10 point type.

Indent the first line of each paragraph by 1/8\textasciitilde{}inch
(except for the first paragraph of a new section). Do not add extra
vertical space between paragraphs.

\section{First-Level Headings}\label{first-level-headings}

First level headings should be in 12 point , initial caps, bold and
centered. Leave one line space above the heading and
1/4\textasciitilde{}line space below the heading.

\subsection{Second-Level Headings}\label{second-level-headings}

Second level headings should be 11 point , initial caps, bold, and flush
left. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4\textasciitilde{}
line space below the heading.

\subsubsection{Third-Level Headings}\label{third-level-headings}

Third-level headings should be 10 point , initial caps, bold, and flush
left. Leave one line space above the heading, but no space after the
heading.

\section{Formalities, Footnotes, and
Floats}\label{formalities-footnotes-and-floats}

Use standard APA citation format. Citations within the text should
include the author's last name and year. If the authors' names are
included in the sentence, place only the year in parentheses, as in
(2007), but otherwise place the entire reference in parentheses with the
authors and year separated by a comma (Garnier, Gautrais, and Theraulaz
2007). List multiple references alphabetically and separate them by
semicolons (Chalnick and Billman 1988; Garnier, Gautrais, and Theraulaz
2007). Use the et. al. construction only after listing all the authors
to a publication in an earlier reference and for citations with four or
more authors.

For more information on citations in R Markdown, see
\textbf{\href{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html\#citations}{here}.}

\subsection{Footnotes}\label{footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes in 9 point type at the
bottom of the page on which they appear. Precede the footnote with a
horizontal rule.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}

\subsection{Figures}\label{figures}

All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
number and caption, in 10 point, after the figure with one line space
above the caption and one line space below it. If necessary, leave extra
white space at the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and
figure caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column,
or set wide figures across both columns.

\subsection{Two-column images}\label{two-column-images}

You can read local images using png package for example and plot it like
a regular plot using grid.raster from the grid package. With this method
you have full control of the size of your image. \textbf{Note: Image
must be in .png file format for the readPNG function to work.}

You might want to display a wide figure across both columns. To do this,
you change the \texttt{fig.env} chunk option to \texttt{figure*}. To
align the image in the center of the page, set \texttt{fig.align} option
to \texttt{center}. To format the width of your caption text, you set
the \texttt{num.cols.cap} option to \texttt{2}.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\captionsetup{width=0.8\textwidth}\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{One-column images}\label{one-column-images}

Single column is the default option, but if you want set it explicitly,
set \texttt{fig.env} to \texttt{figure}. Notice that the
\texttt{num.cols} option for the caption width is set to \texttt{1}.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\captionsetup{width=0.8\columnwidth}\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{R Plots}\label{r-plots}

You can use R chunks directly to plot graphs. And you can use latex
floats in the fig.pos chunk option to have more control over the
location of your plot on the page. For more information on latex
placement specifiers see
\textbf{\href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions}{here}}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{figs/plot-1} 

}

\caption[R plot]{R plot}\label{fig:plot}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{Tables}\label{tables}

Number tables consecutively; place the table number and title (in 10
point) above the table with one line space above the caption and one
line space below it, as in Table 1. You may float tables to the top or
bottom of a column, set wide tables across both columns.

You can use the xtable function in the xtable package.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & Pr($>$$|$t$|$) \\ 
  \hline
(Intercept) & -0.08 & 0.11 & -0.7 & 0.48 \\ 
  x & 2.16 & 0.11 & 19.9 & 0.00 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{This table prints across one column.} 
\end{table}
